<h1>Development Process<h1>

 <p>We basically used godot engine to do everthing and GLSL to control the system of colors</p>
 <p>Sprites were made in aseprite</p>
    
 <p>Obs: Some scripts are not too much optimized due the time (as menus scripts in general), but we felt that we learnt a lot :)</p>
